State is a plain javascript object that is used to record and react to user events.

Each class based component has its own state object.
Whenever the component's state changes, it immediately re-renders, also forcing its children to re-render as well.

Before using state inside of a component you have to initialize the state object.

Functional components do not have state.
ONLY class based components have state.
